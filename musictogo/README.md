musictogo
=========
take your music with you
- little program written in bash that randomly chooses 
  albums of your music library and copies them to an 
  SD-card which goes into your phone or player.
- always copies whole albums either until card is full
  or up to a maximal number of albums to be replaced
- can also distribute music to more than one disk
- sync option: "pseudo sync" of music library to more 
  than one SD-card, mounting one after another
- check musictogo --help for further details

It is mostly meant for people (like me) enjoying one of 
these "high-end" players with high res FLAC files
and limited space on their players. Instead of copying
manually, just run this script to randomly fill your
player to go.
